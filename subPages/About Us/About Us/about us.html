                <h5>A Comprehensive Learning Programs And <span>& Classes For All B.Tech Students</span></h5>
                <p>
                    LearningSimplified is an online learning website where you can become 
                    lifelong learners with in-depth concept explaination and personalised 
                    learning journeys with concept animations and test series These are 
                    not just normal technical stuff, these are fundamental in Programming 
                    and Web development which are crucial and applied everywhere in their 
                    respective fields. These are the mandatory ones which are necessary for
                    a Computer Science Student. So to learn them, we tried to develop a website 
                    from which people can learn basic Programming languages and Web development 
                    for free of cost.
